<p>The National Assembly or Aiwān-e-Zairīñ of Pākistān (Urdu: ایوانِ زیریں پاکستان‬‎, literally "Pakistan lower house") is the lower legislative house of the bicameral Majlis-e-Shura, which also comprises the Senate of Pakistan (upper house).
The National Assembly and the Senate both convene at Parliament House in Islamabad. The National Assembly is a democratically elected body consisting of a total of 336 members, before 25th amendment they used to be 342 who are referred to 
as Members of the National Assembly (MNAs), of which 272 are directly elected members and 70 reserved seats for women and religious minorities. A political party must secure 137 seats to obtain and preserve a majority.[1] Members are elected
through the first-past-the-post system under universal adult suffrage, representing electoral districts known as National Assembly constituencies. According to the constitution, the 70 seats reserved for women and religious minorities are 
allocated to the political parties according to their proportional representation.  Each National Assembly is formed for a five-year term, commencing from the date of the first sitting, after which it is automatically dissolved. Currently the 
National Assembly can not be dissolved by the President of Pakistan; it is dissolved by the Prime Minister of Pakistan. Election for 13th National Assembly was held on 18 February 2008. New session of National Assembly was started from March 
2008. On 17 March 2013, 13th National Assembly was dissolved on completion of its five-year term under Article 52 of the constitution.[2][3] 2013 Pakistani general election (for the 14th National Assembly) was held on 11 May 2013. Members of 
14th National Assembly took oath on 1 June 2013.[4] The 14th National Assembly dissolved on 31 May 2018 upon completing its 5 year term under Article 52 of the constitution. The 15th National Assembly of Pakistan took their oath on 13 August 2018.</p>
